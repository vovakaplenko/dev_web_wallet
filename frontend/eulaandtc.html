                                        Devcore is only involved in the maintenance of the DEV Virtual Coin's public blockchain by performing upgrades and feature addition and will not be responsible for any losses, damages or claims arising from events falling within the scope of the following five (5) categories:

All software, including wallets, are experimental in nature and come with no guarantee whatsoever. Users may download and use them at their own risk and Devcore takes no responsibility for the technical functionalities or the lack thereof.</li>
                                        <li>Technical failures in the hardware of the user of any Virtual Coin-related software or service (i.e. data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device).</li>

                                    Acquiring the Virtual Coin can lead to losses over short or even long periods.

                                    <br />
                                    The users of the Website , Social Media Platforms or Devcore’s software  are solely responsible to determinate what, if any, taxes may or may not apply to their Virtual Coin transactions.
